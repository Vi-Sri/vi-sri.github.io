Just an invisible speck in the pale blue dot trying to make sense of things happening out there. Thriving in the sea of cosmic chaos and indifference, treading in the sea of every increasing entropy. Trying to build artificially and barely intelligent computational codelets that can dream and model real world or whatever we humans call it real, and oh! can also just say if its a cat or a dog.
